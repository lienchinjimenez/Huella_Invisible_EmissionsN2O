## Introduction
The objective of this project is to analyze the nitrous oxide emissions produced by the decomposition of agricultural waste. The data analysis is supported by the application of a time series model from the Prophet library that predicts global nitrous oxide emissions for the year 2030. The discussion of several trained models is addressed, and the one that gives the best result is chosen.


## Context
The context will be conducted through the evolution of agreements and commitments that countries and global powers have established. Economic, social, and government conditions are crucial for the increase or decrease of emissions. This context is important because, for example, if a country's economy suffers, this translates to lower investment and incorporation of technological innovation in agricultural practices that reduce emissions, and then there may be a growing trend.

## Methodology
The project has taken one month to be carried out during the Data Science Master's program at Assembler Institute of Technology. The basic bibliographic material has been manuals and protocols, journalistic and academic articles, both external and internal to organizations (IPCC, FAOSTAT, MITECO, etc).

## Data
The dataset comes from the FAOSTAT (Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database) database, covering the years 1961-2020 and having worldwide coverage. On the one hand, it contains countries, continents, regions, and types of countries (whether they are developed or not); on the other hand, it contains products (the type of crop), the type of element (agricultural waste and type of emission), and finally, the years and the amount of N2O emissions in thousands of tons.

## Results
The data shows that the main N2O emitters are the USA, China, India, and Brazil. Countries with developing economies generate more N2O emissions.

## Conclusions
The conclusion is that, although developing countries such as India, Brazil, and formerly China have emitted large amounts of emissions, the responsibility lies with those with greater technological innovation, not only countries but also private companies. We need geotechnology to be transformed, and private companies' efforts to focus on achieving the objectives established in the Paris Agreement and limiting global warming.

The intention is to continue exploring other datasets that are part of the Climate Change section of FAOSTAT, registered in the agriculture, forestry, and land use sector, in addition to contextualizing the countries and the philosophical issue at the level.
